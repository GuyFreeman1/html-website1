    <img src="./images/annabelle.jpg" alt="Annabelle Poster">
    <p>John Form has found the perfect gift for his expectant wife, Mia - a beautiful, rare vintage doll in a pure white wedding dress</p>
    <p>But Mia's delight with Annabelle doesn't last long. On one horrific night,</p>
    <p>their home is invaded by members of a satanic cult, who violently attack the couple.</p>
    <p>Spilled blood and terror are not all they leave behind.</p>
    <p>The cultists have conjured an entity so malevolent that nothing they did will compare to the sinister conduit to the damned that is now... Annabelle.</p>
