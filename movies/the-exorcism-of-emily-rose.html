    <p>When a younger girl called Emily Rose dies,</p>
    <p>everyone puts blame on the exorcism which was performed on her by Father Moore prior to her death.</p>
    <p>The priest is arrested on suspicion of murder.</p>
    <p>The trial begins with lawyer Erin Bruner representing Moore, but it is not going to be easy, as no one wants to believe what Father Moore says is true.</p>
