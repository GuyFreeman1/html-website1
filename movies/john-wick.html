    <img src="./images/john-wick.jpg" alt="John Wick Poster">
    <p>With the untimely death of his beloved wife still bitter in his mouth, John Wick,</p>
    <p>the expert former assassin, receives one final gift from her--a precious keepsake to help John find a new meaning in life</p>
    <p>now that she is gone.</p>
    <p>But when the arrogant Russian mob prince, Iosef Tarasov, and his men pay Wick a rather unwelcome visit to rob him of his prized 1969 Mustang and his wife's present,</p>
    <p>the legendary hitman will be forced to unearth his meticulously concealed identity.</p>
