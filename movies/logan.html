    <img src="./images/logan.jpg" alt="Logan Poster">
    <p>In 2029 the mutant population has shrunk significantly due to genetically modified plants designed to reduce mutant powers and the X-Men have disbanded</p>
    <p> Logan, whose power to self-heal is dwindling, has surrendered himself to alcohol and now earns a living as a chauffeur.</p>
    <p>When a younger girl called Emily Rose dies,</p>
    <p>He takes care of the ailing old Professor X whom he keeps hidden away.</p>
    <p>One day, a female stranger asks Logan to drive a girl named Laura to the Canadian border</p>
    <p> At first he refuses, but the Professor has been waiting for a long time for her to appear. Laura possesses an extraordinary fighting prowess and is in many ways like Wolverine.</p>
