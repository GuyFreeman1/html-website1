    <p>In 1971, Carolyn and Roger Perron move their family into a dilapidated Rhode Island farm house and soon strange things start happening around it</p>
    <p>with escalating nightmarish terror. In desperation, Carolyn contacts the noted paranormal investigators,</p>
    <p>Ed and Lorraine Warren, to examine the house. What the Warrens discover is a whole area steeped in a satanic haunting</p>
    <p>that is now targeting the Perron family wherever they go. To stop this evil,</p>
    <p>the Warrens will have to call upon all their skills and spiritual strength to defeat this spectral menace at its source that threatens to destroy everyone involved.</p>
